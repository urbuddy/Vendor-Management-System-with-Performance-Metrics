# Vendor-Management-System-with-Performance-Metrics

# Objective
      Develop a Vendor Management System using Django and Django REST Framework. This
      system will handle vendor profiles, track purchase orders, and calculate vendor performance
      metrics.
      
# Core Features
  1. Vendor Profile Management:
     
  ● Model Design: Create a model to store vendor information including name, contact
  details, address, and a unique vendor code.
  
  ● API Endpoints:
  
    ● POST /api/vendors/: Create a new vendor.

    ● GET /api/vendors/: List all vendors.
    
    ● GET /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Retrieve a specific vendor's details.
    
    ● PUT /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Update a vendor's details.

    ● DELETE /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Delete a vendor.

  2. Purchase Order Tracking:
     
  ● Model Design: Track purchase orders with fields like PO number, vendor reference,
  order date, items, quantity, and status.
  
  ● API Endpoints:
  
    ● POST /api/purchase_orders/: Create a purchase order.
    
    ● GET /api/purchase_orders/: List all purchase orders with an option to filter by
    vendor.
    
    ● GET /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Retrieve details of a specific purchase order.
    
    ● PUT /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Update a purchase order.
    
    ● DELETE /api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Delete a purchase order.
    
  3. Vendor Performance Evaluation:
     
  ● Metrics:
  
    ● On-Time Delivery Rate: Percentage of orders delivered by the promised date.
    
    ● Quality Rating: Average of quality ratings given to a vendor’s purchase orders.
    
    ● Response Time: Average time taken by a vendor to acknowledge or respond to
    purchase orders.
    
    ● Fulfilment Rate: Percentage of purchase orders fulfilled without issues.
    
  ● Model Design: Add fields to the vendor model to store these performance metrics.
  
  ● API Endpoints:
  
    ● GET /api/vendors/{vendor_id}/performance: Retrieve a vendor's performance metrics.
